# Sidebar Heading Preview

This Obsidian plugin adds a tooltip preview of the first-level headings (`#`) from a note when you hover over it in the sidebar.

### Features

- Quickly preview top-level headings without opening the note
- Clean tooltip design that appears after a short delay
- Saves time when navigating large vaults

### How it works

When you hover over a file in the file explorer (sidebar), the plugin shows a small tooltip containing the `#` headings from that file.
