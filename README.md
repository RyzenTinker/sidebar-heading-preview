# Sidebar Heading Preview

This Obsidian plugin adds a tooltip preview of the first-level headings (`#`) from a note when you hover over it in the sidebar.

### Features

- Instantly preview top-level headings (# Heading) on hover without opening the note  
- Clean and responsive tooltip design with smooth alignment  
- Adds bullet points to each heading for better visual clarity  
- Customizable appearance via styles.css (easy theming support)  
- Saves time when navigating large vaults with many files  

### How it works

When you hover over a file name in the Obsidian file explorer (sidebar), a small tooltip appears near your cursor after a short delay.  
This tooltip shows the top-level headings (# Heading) found in the file, styled with bullets and improved readability.

If a file doesn't contain any # Heading, no tooltip appears.

### Styling

The tooltip's appearance is controlled via `styles.css`, allowing for easy customization.  
You can adjust font sizes, colors, shadows, or other visual elements to better match your Obsidian theme.

If you're using this plugin manually, make sure `styles.css` is placed alongside `main.js` and `manifest.json` in the plugin folder.
