# Sidebar Heading Preview

This Obsidian plugin adds a tooltip preview of the first-level headings (`#`) from a note when you hover over it in the sidebar.

### Features

- Instantly preview top-level headings (# Heading) on hover without opening the note
- Clean and responsive tooltip design with smooth alignment
- Adds bullet points to each heading for better visual clarity
- Customizable appearance via styles.css (easy theming support)
- Saves time when navigating large vaults with many files



### How it works

When you hover over a file name in the Obsidian file explorer (sidebar), a small tooltip appears near your cursor after a short delay. This tooltip shows the top-level headings (# Heading) found in the file, styled with bullets and improved readability.

If a file doesn't contain any # Heading, no tooltip appears.
